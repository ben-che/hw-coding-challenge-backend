# To run:
1. Navigate to the root directly in your terminal
2. Ensure that your machine has node and npm installed - this project uses
a number of npm packages
3. Ensure that all the csv files are in the `backend-assessment` folder - 
if there is a file missing, the script will throw an error
4. In the root directory type `npm install` in your terminal
5. To write the file, type `node index.js` in your terminal - you should see
a success message and a new file called `reportcards.txt`

### Some nice to knows
- Instead of throwing errors and stoping the code when something fails a test,
I console log a warning instead
- The output file is generated in the root directory of the project, as
reportcards.txt
